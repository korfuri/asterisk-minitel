My attempts at reviving the Minitel.

This repository is a work in progress, but it includes 2 main parts:

* A NixOS-compatible configuration for Asterisk with app_softmodem,
  including the Asterisk configuration to make use of it;
* A Python application that provides Minitel services (3615-style).

I intend to polish this more and add documentation when it's a bit
more stable. If I abandon this halfway, feel free to reuse it, or
email me (korfuri at g mail) with questions.
